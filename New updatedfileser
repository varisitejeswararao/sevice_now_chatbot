1. Objective

Objective:
The purpose of this document is to outline the success and failure criteria for implementing a machine learning solution within the ServiceNow platform. This project aims to enhance workflows by automating incident categorization, prioritization, and resolution processes to improve efficiency and compliance with business goals.

Scope:

In Scope:

Incident Management: Automation of incident categorization and routing.

Change Management: Streamlined workflows with machine learning integration.

Performance Monitoring: Tracking and ensuring SLA compliance.


Out of Scope:

HR-specific modules.

Custom workflows unrelated to ITSM.



Stakeholders:

IT Operations Team

ServiceNow Administrators

Data Science Team

Business Owners

2. Success Criteria

2.1 Model Performance

The model must achieve a minimum accuracy of 90% in incident classification.

Precision, recall, and F1-score must meet or exceed 0.85 across all test cases.

API response time for categorization should not exceed 200 milliseconds.


2.2 Data Quality and Workflows

Training and validation datasets should be 95% complete, accurate, and representative of incident patterns.

The solution must integrate seamlessly with ServiceNow workflows, ensuring zero disruption during implementation.


2.3 Automation Impact

The model must reduce manual effort in categorizing incidents by at least 50%.

SLA adherence rates for incidents must improve by 15% post-deployment.


2.4 Deployment and Integration

The machine learning model must deploy successfully in the ServiceNow environment, maintaining 99% uptime.

All configuration items (CIs) and relationships in the CMDB must be updated without errors.


2.5 Compliance and Governance

The model must comply with company data protection policies and global regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

All machine learning-driven actions must be logged in ServiceNow audit trails for transparency.


2.6 Business Objectives

Incident resolution time must be reduced by 20%.

Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) must increase by at least 10%.

3. Failure Criteria

3.1 Model Performance

Accuracy of the model falls below 85%.

Response time for API calls exceeds 500 milliseconds.


3.2 Data Issues

Training data contains more than 5% incomplete or incorrect records.

The model fails to handle edge cases, leading to incorrect incident classification in more than 10% of cases.


3.3 Automation Failures

More than 10% of incidents are misrouted, resulting in SLA breaches.

The model introduces bottlenecks, slowing down workflows instead of improving efficiency.


3.4 Integration Issues

API calls to ServiceNow fail more than 5 times per day.

The integration disrupts existing workflows, causing downtime in production.


3.5 Ethical and Compliance Issues

Unauthorized actions or changes are made to incidents or configuration items (CIs).

Breaches in data privacy regulations are detected.

4. Testing Methodology

4.1 Testing Scenarios

Incident Categorization: Validate classification accuracy using a test dataset.

Workflow Integration: Test the modelâ€™s performance within ServiceNow staging environments.

Stress Testing: Simulate heavy loads to ensure scalability and stability.


4.2 Datasets Used

Historical incident data from ServiceNow for training and validation.

Simulated data to test edge cases and anomalies.


4.3 Validation Metrics

Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and API response times.

SLA compliance rates pre- and post-implementation.


4.4 Tools and Frameworks

ServiceNow APIs: For seamless integration and testing of workflows.

Machine Learning Platforms: For model development and training (e.g., Azure ML, Databricks).

Monitoring Tools: To track performance and uptime (e.g., ServiceNow Performance Analytics, Dynatrace).
