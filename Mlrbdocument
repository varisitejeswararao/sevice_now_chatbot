Machine Learning Review Board (MLRB)

Success and Failure Criteria Document

Project Name: [Insert Project Name]
Date: [Insert Date]
Prepared By: [Your Name/Team Name]
Version: 1.0


---

1. Objective

Provide a clear overview of the project and its purpose.

Objective: [Insert the purpose of the machine learning project, e.g., "To develop a predictive model for patient readmission rates."]

Scope: [Define what the project includes and excludes.]

Stakeholders: [List the key stakeholders (e.g., data scientists, business teams, compliance officers).]



---

2. Success Criteria

Define the measurable and objective criteria for the success of the machine learning model:

2.1 Model Performance

The model must achieve a minimum accuracy of [X%].

Precision, recall, and F1-score must exceed [X threshold].

ROC-AUC score of at least [X threshold].


2.2 Data Quality

Training and testing datasets must be [at least X%] complete, free of duplicates, and consistent.

No significant class imbalance exceeding a ratio of [X].


2.3 Scalability and Robustness

The model should scale to process [X volume of data] within [Y seconds].

The model must maintain performance on unseen datasets with less than [X%] degradation.


2.4 Compliance and Ethics

The model complies with [specific regulations, e.g., GDPR, HIPAA].

No significant bias is detected for [specific groups/populations].


2.5 Business Objectives

The model reduces [specific metric, e.g., cost, error rates] by [X%].

The solution must integrate successfully into existing workflows.


2.6 Deployment Readiness

The model passes staging tests with [X%] uptime in the staging environment.

APIs are tested and show response times below [X milliseconds].



---

3. Failure Criteria

Clearly outline what constitutes failure:

3.1 Model Performance

The model fails to meet minimum thresholds for accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

Performance metrics degrade significantly on validation or unseen datasets.


3.2 Data Issues

Training datasets contain more than [X%] missing or incorrect values.

Significant data bias results in unfair or unreliable predictions.


3.3 Ethical Violations

The model shows discriminatory behavior against specific demographics.

Violates regulatory requirements such as [specific compliance laws].


3.4 Scalability Issues

The model cannot process [X volume of data] within the required timeframe.

Model predictions fail under heavy workload or real-time constraints.


3.5 Business Misalignment

The solution does not address the business problem or fails to deliver measurable impact.

Key stakeholders reject the model due to poor outcomes or usability issues.



---

4. Testing Methodology

Describe how success and failure criteria will be validated:

Testing Scenarios: [Include specific scenarios, e.g., stress testing, cross-validation, real-world simulation.]

Datasets Used: [Specify the datasets for training, testing, and validation.]

Tools and Frameworks: [List the tools or frameworks, e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Azure.]

Validation Metrics: [State the metrics used, e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix, latency.]



---

5. Results Documentation

Use this section to track and report results after testing:

Model Version: [Insert version or iteration.]

Performance Metrics: [Provide metrics for validation.]

Feedback from Stakeholders: [Include approval or rejection notes.]

Next Steps: [Define actions based on the outcomes.]
